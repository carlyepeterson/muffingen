 * UPDATE DOCUMENTATION!!!

 * complete MIT comparison configs and experiments 
 
 * re-do border cleanup if it has been user-edited
 
 * relax islands constraints.
   (Currently it requires a seperation of land masses sufficient to fit 2 non overlapping paths between in order to count them as separate islands.
   Also land seperated by only 1 ocean cell from the pole is counted as part of the polar island.)
  
 * add a setting to optimize land fraction automatically?

 * create GUI!!!

+++ muffingen DONE +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * add option for loading in template k1 file
   (in this: strip out boundary rows and columns to create a simple mask)
   
 * create versions of basic 36x36 pol and eq configs and TEST
   => this becomes the proof-of-concept (1st) test stage and test of basic usability
   
 * create new 36x36 modern config and TEST
   => this is the 2nd test stage and now a test with 'real' config

 *** SORT OUT .PATHS -- STILL SOMETHING WRONG WITH HOW IT IS CREATED ***
 
 * add in further mask filtering options
 
 * add in wind product generation

 * add in the ability to generate non-equal area grids
   
 * add in SEDGEM file generation
   
 * convert k-levels back to topo and plot
 
 * calculate areas of input and output masks
 
 * add iteration to removal of orphan border cells
   
 * create user-creatable/editable mask
 
 * create user-creatable/editable topo
   
 * add in albedo generation
   + GENIE code to read in 2D file rather than parameter values
     
 * fix situation with pole-to-pole continent  
 
 * enable ASCII input for mask (i.e. non space seperated columns)
   -> '1' = ocean, everything else land
     
 * create new 36x36 (& 18x18) modern config with the new wind products and TEST
 
 * create new 36x36 Eocene config and TEST
   => this is the 3rd test stage
 
 * create new 36x36 Eocene config and TEST
   => this is the 4th test stage -- of generated SEDGEM config
     
 * make wind filenames ocnsistent between re-gridding and zonal mean
   
 * automatically generate relevant part of .config file
   
 * fix bug in paths cleanup (path rings) as manisfested in sandy config
 
 * update plotting / netCDF output for PSI
 
 * generate albedo profile (from equation ... default values?)

 * add calculation of solar constant and salinity (from age)

+++ muffingen CUTTING ROOM FLOOR +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   ALSO: add in option for spcifying default ocean depth (i.e. different from max depth)
 
 * in messaging -- report FULL filenames
   
 * instead of muffingen exiting with an error if a path cannot be followed
   -> bring up the editing window to edit the borders, and try following again
   (i.e. rather than the default being to user-edit -- only if an error occurs)
 
 * add parameter to set minimum k (maximum water depth) (e.g. for flat-bottom oceans)
